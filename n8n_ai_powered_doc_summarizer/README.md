How it works?
This workflow automatically watches a Google Drive folder for new files (Google Docs or PDFs). When a document is added:

- Detects file type â†’ Google Doc vs PDF.
- Extracts text (Google Docs via API, PDFs via text extraction).
- Summarizes & analyzes content using OpenAI.
- Sends results as a notification to Slack and/or via Email.

Who is this for?
- Business teams that want quick digests of reports, proposals, or contracts.
- Educators / researchers who need summaries of long study materials.
- Founders / managers who want daily summaries without opening every file.
- Operations teams that track compliance or documentation.

What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case
- Reading long documents is time-consuming.
- Sharing key points across teams often requires manual effort.
- Context (sentiment, action items) is often missed.
ðŸ‘‰ This workflow solves it by auto-summarizing and notifying, making knowledge sharing instant.
